# code-quiz

# Description
This github repository contains a simple coding quiz containing 5 questions all with 4 answers to select from. Only one of the answers is correct of the four available choices. Upon loading the webpage you can start the quiz, at which point a timer will begin counting down from 50 seconds. If you answer a question correctly or incorrectly then you move on to the next question and a message is displayed whether you were right or wrong. If you were wrong a penalty of 10 seconds is deducted from the timer. If the timer reaches zero or you finish all the questions then the quiz will end and take you to a page to submit your name. After submitting your name you will be taken to a high score page to see how you did against everyone else.
